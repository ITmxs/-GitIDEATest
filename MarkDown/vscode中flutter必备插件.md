# Flutter development





I've been working with Flutter in Visual Studio Code for almost a year now, and it drastically accelerated mobile development for me. Flutter makes it painless to craft aesthetic UIs. Gone are the days of XML layouts. Coupled with Visual Studio Code and these incredible plugins, the Flutter experience is butter smooth. Without further ado, here are my top plugin picks for better fluttering.

## [Flutter + Dart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)

Inevitably, first on the list is the official Flutter plugin by Danny Tuppeny. These add syntax highlighting, suggestions/fixes, snippets and debugging support. Download [here.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)

## [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)

![尝试找到括号时不再费劲！](https://blog.maskys.com/content/images/2019/02/screenshot-2.png)No more eye-strain while trying to find brackets!

There are a *lot* of brackets in Flutter code. Once you start nesting widgets, it becomes strenuous to locate the brackets' pairs. Thankfully, Better Brackets plugin makes it painless. Get it [here.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)



## [Material Theme](https://material-theme.site/) + [Material Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)

These two plugins are fantastic to make your VSCode work space aesthetic. With 8 different themes and hundreds of flat icons, it doesn't get better than this. My personal favorites are Ocean and Palenight.

## [Pubspec Assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeroen-meijer.pubspec-assist)

![嗯哇](https://blog.maskys.com/content/images/2019/02/pubspec-demo.gif)Um, wow.

This one's a godsend. Once you start fluttering, you will find yourself often leaving the editor and heading to Dart Pub to copy some dependency text, or to find the latest version number.  Use [Pubspec Assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeroen-meijer.pubspec-assist) and never mess up your flow again.

## [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

Better comments makes it easier to read comments through color coding. There's one major feature left out in the above screenshot, and that's the ability to set TODOs. They'll even appear in your *Problems* tab in the side/bottom panel, just like in IntelliJ. What's more, you can also set custom styling.

## [Gitlens](https://gitlens.amod.io/#)

Last but not the least, GitLens integrates numerous Git features into Visual Studio Code. You can jump between repositories, see who wrote that line, when and why it was changed, switch between commits in the past, and more. [Let's Git coding.](https://gitlens.amod.io/#)

## Bonus: Move Bottom Panel to the side.

Right looks infinitely better.

Having the Panel at the bottom takes up a lot of space that you could use to read more code. Move your panel to the side instead (your code shouldn't exceed 80 chars anyway) to use space more efficiently. Open Settings by hitting `Ctrl` + `,`. Then, search for `"Panel location"`. Change it from `bottom` to `right`.



Well, that's about it.  These plugins are all epic, and the contributors behind them deserve a huge thanks. Do you know of any other gem? Let me know below 👇
